Note 1: This program serves as a basic template or reference for beginners in PHP or those seeking a structure similar to the .NET Framework in PHP.

Note 2: The code was developed in one afternoon, so I acknowledge that optimizations can be made.

Recommendations for newcomers:

Ensure "display_errors = On" and "extension=pdo_mysql" are configured in your php.ini file if necessary.
If you're unsure of the file's location, use the command "php --ini" in your command prompt (CMD) to locate it.
To run the application, use the following command or your preferred method: "php -S localhost:9999"
